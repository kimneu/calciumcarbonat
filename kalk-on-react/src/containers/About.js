    <p>KALK is an open-minded project for material art and objects of use.
        <br/><br/>Created by Ramona Gschwend (Polydesign 3D) and Juri Roemmel (Graphic Designer) in early 2015, KALK is a platform for creative output. Under the KALK label, artists and artisans work together on projects spanning different areas of
        object creation, focusing mostly on fashion, design, and object of use.
        <br/><br/>KALK believes in exploring the materiality of objects, often working with raw and almost unprocessed materials. The process and experience of designing and creating an object is as important to KALK as the final product itself.
        <br/><br/>All products are handmade in Switzerland. Fabrics and and other materials are sourced from Switzerland or Europe.
